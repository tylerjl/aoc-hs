        <p>
          <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> by <a href="https://github.com/topaz">@topaz</a> is sort of an institution at this point.
          I've done it a few times over the years, and usually use the event as an excuse to learn a new language.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a lot of fun!
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem sets vary widely, which present an opportunity to get a good look at many aspects of a new or unfamiliar programming language.
          I did so with Haskell, the results of which I've cobbled together here to present in unified form.
          The dates here range back to 2015 - back then I was sort of green at Haskell, I've since done much more Haskell programming and may solve additional AoC challenges in the future using Haskell.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took advantage of a small project with only myself at the helm to really dig into diferent parts of the ecosystem: <a href="https://www.haskellstack.org/">stack</a> (a Haskell build tool), various testing and benchmarking libraries, and some libraries like <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa">Repa</a> to understand what high-performing Haskell code looks like.
          Recent changes include relying on <code>nix flake</code> for a dev environment/dependency management.
          Some of what you'll see is very much overkill, but the purpose here is to see examples for the variety of tools and methods Haskell provides.
        </p>
        <p>
          This whole exercise is intended to be a learning experience, so if you have any comments/questions/feedback/fixes for my horrible code, please do feel free to collaborate with me on GitHub!
        </p>

        <h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/tylerjl/aoc-hs">
            Source
          </a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          All of the source code is hosted on GitHub.
          The <code>README.md</code> is pretty straightforward if you want to build it yourself: <code>nix</code> and <code>stack</code> makes the process eminently reproducible.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <a href="haddock">
            Documentation
          </a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a> is the de facto documentation generation tool, so the solution HTML documentation is provided as an example of what that process looks like.
          Note the <code>Source</code> links accompanying the functions and datatypes if you're curious about what inline Haddock documentation looks like.
        </p>
        <h3>

        <p>
          <a href="http://www.serpentine.com/criterion/">Criterion</a> is a benchmarking utility that creates really fantastic metrics.
          As of this writing, I haven't yet completed benchmarking all of the functions in the challenge problem set, but the existing benchmarks give you a good idea of what it looks like.
        </p>

          <a href="coverage">
            Coverage

        </h3>
        <p>
          I used <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_program_coverage">HPC</a> to generate reports about code coverage.
          The reports cover statistics such as code branches that never get evaluated, expressions that only ever evaluate to one value, and other potential red flags.
